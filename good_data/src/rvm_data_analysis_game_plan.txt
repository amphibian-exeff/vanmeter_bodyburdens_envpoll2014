rvm data analysis game plan 

1. Descriptive statistics
a) distribution fitting for response and explanatory variables of collected data
--- body weight across 8 spp. (n=25)
--- body burdens across 8 spp. and 5 pesticides (n=5)
--- pchem properties across 5 pesticides and across all pesticides
------ Kow, solubility, molecular mass
------ Koc: lit, calculated, and measured
--- measured soil concentrations across 5 pesticides
b) lognormal transformations of collected data as appropriate
c) calculation of derivative response and explanatory variables
--- response
------appfactor (no double log)
------bcf/transfer coefficient
------rations of spray/not spray body burdens
--- explanatory
------habitat factor (categorical)
------species (categorical)
------skin thickness (not f(bw))
------surface area (f(bw))
d) lognormal transformation of calculated variables as appropriate
e) gcms v lcms (when both were run)
------body burden
------soil concentrations
f) deal with the number of frogs- bodyweight2 = bodyweight/N
g) surfacearea2 = f(bodyweight2)
h) appfactor2 = f(bodyweight2,surfacearea2)

2. regression/anova/ancova
a) decisions on continuous/categorical variables (spp., habitat factor)
- a single regression for these parent pesticides ('Total Atrazine', 'Total Fipronil', 'Total Triadimefon', 'Imidacloprid', 'Pendimethalin')
- grab where good == 1
------ koc, expKoc, logKow as single chemical predictors
------ species or habitat classifier as categorical predictor
------ appfactor ~ habitat + species + loglow + log?koc + henryslaw? + vaporpressure + human_spc? + molmass
------ soil conc ~ app_rate + log?koc + henryslaw? + vapor pressure + logKow
------ tissue conc ~ habitat + species + logkow + log?koc + henryslaw? + vaporpressure + human_spc? + apprate + bodyweight2 + surface area??
------ BCF ~ habitat + species + logkow + log?koc + henryslaw? + vaporpressure + human_spc?
------ with and without mole salamander
b) variable selection
---larger data set of pchem properties (where do the pesticides we selected fall on the pdf)
---consideration of correlations between explanatory variables (plot)
c) stepwise/combinatorics of anova/ancova
d) variable importance measures
---standardized regression coefficients
---r_2 (stepwise)
---adj r^2 (stepwise)
---AIC (stepwise)
---BIC (stepwise)
e) model comparison
---r_2
---adj r^2
---AIC
---BIC

3. machine learning approaches
a) what are necessary sample sizes for data mining problems
b) classification methods appropriate for ecotox audience or separate manuscript
c) 5 out of 1200 problem

4. inference to amphibian exposure and risk (statistical support for discussion of manuscript)
a) can we reject (dominant, mammal-based) Kow approaches to predict dermal uptake
--- does appfactor ~ logKow suck?
b) is the predictive power of best models that we find generalizable to:
--- other frogs
------ is frog classifier important? hope not but ancova necessary
--- other pesticides
------ we have a problem
--- other exposure situations (non-liquid spray)
------ outside the scope of this study
--- other soil types (lower OM)
------ we have a problem, more experiments planned
--- time of year
------ good for pre-emergents before vegetative cover
------ amphibian life cycle, when are they moving
c) do the best models we find make physical sense (in a process sense?)
--- is the direction of the coefficient monotonic
--- does the sign of the coefficient make sense
--- does the fit not suck and/or is it over-fitted?
